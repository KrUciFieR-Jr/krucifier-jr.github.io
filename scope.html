					<h4>Beta Bahut Scope hai</h4>
					<p><b>People</b> guided my education not me.My Science and Maths Marks were great ! I was the topper in science in my school.I had great interest in physics.So my father decided to join me in an IIT Coaching Class. Although I never had that capability to make into an IIT but i was fortunate enough to get into a good college.Well speaking precisely it's one of best college in Mumbai</p>
					<p><strong>"Computer Science mil gaya ab toh teri life sort hai beta."</strong> echo of several relatives whom i dont even know were running through my medula oblongata as i took my first steps towards my new Hardcore Gujarati College</p>
					<p>I still felt something wrong when i took my intial steps towards my classroom.I was lucky enough to have great seniors they guided us in most friendly way possible and took our nervousness smoothly.</p>
					<p>First few days were great ! I made new friends and everything was fine until my intutions came true <strong>Same Bandwagon!!</strong> started here too .<strong>"Beta MS karle beta bohot scope!!"</strong></p>
					<p>The one thing i realized about this type of thinking is that they are never gonna leave you in life.</p>
					<p>Problem is not the statement by the people but its their Mentality.People tend to look for their monetary and social benefits.They just forgot who <b>they are</b> by chasing Who <b>they want to be</b> . I mean its fine to keep an Idol but just becoming a replica of your Idol is not the ethical way of living your life.</p>
					<p>I am also not saying that if other people are doing a particular thing then dont it.You can still better than them , for e.g Their was a social networking site called <b>Orkut</b> but as time proceed <b>Facebook</b> came took over their market .</p>
					<p>All I am trying to point is that this whole fiasco is about you not about them.If you want to do MS/MBA great go ahead.</p>
					<p>Atleast you will not regret about your life and not try to blame others for your decision.You will just grow if you apply this to your life (Trust me bruh !! faced a lot of backstabbing).</p>
					<p>Lastly, All I want to say to my readers is that <b>Stay Original</b>.</p>
					<p>In your life you are the protagonist and others pedastrains while in their life they are the protagonist and you are just a mere pedastrain</p>
					<p>Do what you what you are destined to do rather than letting others create your destiny.</p>
					<p>Thank you for Reading ! Hope you like it.</p>
					<p>Peace Out !!!<img src="assets/img/portfolio/spock.png"></p>
